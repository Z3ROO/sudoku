## This is a simple Sudoku game built from scratch.

It is built using Typescript, React and styled components as its only dependencies.

It includes its own Sudoku Board Generator, so each match is as unique as it can be.

> In case you try to run tests in the board be aware of the amount of boards being tested. It is currently 1000 boards and it can take a while.
